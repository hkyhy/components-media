00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.580
Welcome to LHH's Career Transition Services.
You’ve taken an important first step by

2
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.821
beginning the program your employer or former
employer provided. We’re excited to work

3
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:23.980
with you to reach your career goals. You may not have heard 
of LHH until recently,

4
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.460
but we are well known in the Human Resources
world. We are a global organization working

5
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.040
with Fortune 500 companies and smaller organizations
across industries, supporting people from

6
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.910
all functions and at every level in the organization.
Separating from an organization is difficult.

7
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.020
It involves change. It is our goal to support you, providing you

8
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.320
with tools to guide you. With our help and your resilience, 
you can manage the most effective

9
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.710
and efficient job search. At LHH, coaching is at the 
heart of everything

10
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.390
we do. Your job search is driven by personal support 
from our Career Consultants and through

11
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.580
productivity tools, which can help you land a better job faster.

12
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.340
In this session, we will review the services
and resources available to you. You will be

13
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.030
provided with support in three significant ways:

14
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.940
First, we will focus on brand development, helping you create a
clear message, your

15
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.450
professional brand. Secondly, you are matched with a dedicated

16
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.159
Career Consultant, or Coach who supports you through your job search.

17
00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.270
And third, you will be able to access the many tools and
 resources available on the

18
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.399
Career Resource Network (CRN). We will address each 
of these in this session.

19
00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.290
Let’s jump right in. Once you’ve received an email with your

20
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.530
access to the Career Resource Network (CRN),
you are ready to begin. You can access the

21
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.152
CRN on any device. Starting on the Career Resource 
Network Home page, 

22
00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:10.051
you will see your transition team ever-present
in the upper right-hand corner. You are at

23
00:02:10.051 --> 00:02:16.720
the center of your job search, and to support
you is your personal LHH Career Consultant,

24
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.020
and Ella, a Digital Career Agent, working together to 
help you transition successfully.

25
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.519
The Home page offers a command center, where
you can find:

26
00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.049
Your progress, To-Do's This Week,

27
00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.240
Your Upcoming Events, and

28
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.329
Recommended Resources – personalized
for your goal.

29
00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:46.519
When you first accessed your CRN, you selected
a goal that matches your job search intentions.

30
00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:53.690
You chose from landing a similar job, or a career shift, 
becoming an entrepreneur, improving

31
00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.870
your career through retraining and education,
entering active retirement, or choosing the

32
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.192
gig economy doing a variety of things you love to do.

33
00:03:05.192 --> 00:03:11.520
Your goal can be changed at any time. Based on your goal
selection, you are provided

34
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.220
with a list of things “To Do” which can
jumpstart your career transition.

35
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.580
In addition to your Career Consultant, Ella will continue 
to personalize your experience

36
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.700
by recommending content and actions for you
throughout your search. Ella helps you search

37
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.220
for jobs, without compromising your data. Ella delivers job
 leads based on your preferences

38
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.790
and refines job recommendations based on your feedback.

39
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.823
Developing your personal brand requires determining
who you are, what you bring to the table today,

40
00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:51.880
and how you differ from the competition. You
have access to resources including tools and

41
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.769
templates to help you develop your brand.
Of course, one very important document that

42
00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.420
reflects your brand is your resume. One of the first 
To-Do’s will be to upload

43
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.900
your resume to the Digital Talent Exchange,
LHH’s proprietary database. Rest assured,

44
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.549
the employers viewing our candidate resumes
have been researched, reviewed, and approved

45
00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.840
by our team to ensure your privacy and security.
We have thousands of employers and recruiters

46
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.710
accessing our database to find their ideal candidates. 
That is why we encourage you to

47
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.520
post your resume as quickly as possible to
the Digital Talent Exchange, even if it has

48
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.370
not yet been reviewed. You can always upload
your updated resume later!

49
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.050
If you ARE looking to get a review of your resume by an 
LHH Professional Branding Specialist,

50
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.390
another “To Do” suggests you send your resume to start the process.

51
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.600
The Professional Branding Specialist will send back your
 resume with feedback in a few

52
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.950
business days. Depending on your program, you may 
virtually meet with the Professional

53
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.730
Branding Specialist to complete the review. Be sure to 
review the changes prior to your

54
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.743
meeting, to ensure the time is as productive as possible.

55
00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:18.480
At your meeting, the Professional Branding
Specialist will go over your revisions and

56
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.300
make some final edits. They will also review your LinkedIn profile

57
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.120
and provide you with tips to ensure employers
can find you and see the great skills and

58
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.500
experience you offer. As you manage your job
search, keep in mind, many times, employers

59
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:42.520
use social media platforms to find candidates.
Make sure your online presence reflects your

60
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.150
personal brand. Your LHH program includes a Career Consultant

61
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.350
to provide a customized approach to your search.
You are matched with a Career Consultant who

62
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.310
will meet with you one-to-one, and assist
you - where you are in your job search.

63
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.650
They may help you explore your career interests
and skills to determine your career options.

64
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:13.200
They can work with you to develop a marketing
plan, help you get ready to network, interview,

65
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.790
and negotiate offers for a proactive and productive
search.

66
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.740
Perhaps the most engaging aspect of the program
is the access you will have to the many tools

67
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.220
and resources available on the Career Resource
Network (CRN).

68
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.520
Our Career Resource Network provides you with
a Roadmap to help you stay on track and move

69
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.297
toward success. Go to the Roadmap tab at the top left of the CRN.

70
00:06:40.297 --> 00:06:43.930
The RoadMap is organized by topics to move

71
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.570
you toward success. You can proceed in order, or jump to a specific

72
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.500
topic of interest along your Roadmap. Within
each topic, you are guided with numerous

73
00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:03.500
actions including articles, videos, podcasts
and events you can register for. The events

74
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.100
are hosted by experienced Career Consultants,
and you can attend as many as you like.

75
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:17.070
These suggested actions will help you develop new skills 
and support you through a successful transition. 

76
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.950
Once you have completed the action, you will see a 
checkmark indicating you have

77
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:28.100
accomplished the task. As you continue to move 
through actions, you can see your progress.

78
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.570
You can also find all the tools and resources
we offer, regardless of your specified goal,

79
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:41.330
by selecting the “Explore” Menu tab. Here you can 
also find premium tools such

80
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:49.419
as LinkedIn Learning to develop new skills, stay sharp 
and compete for exciting opportunities.

81
00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:55.540
You can also access D&B Hoovers to research
your targeted companies and use the Interview

82
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.340
Center to practice your interviewing skills.
These are just a few of the many tools and

83
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:06.300
resources available to you on the Career Resource Network.

84
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:12.740
You may be new to the job search, but LHH
is not. We know what works, and we have the

85
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.150
tools to help you find the best opportunity quickly.

86
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.040
If you have been in a job search before, you
know that it can take a little time and a

87
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:29.050
lot of effort. Some days are not easy. You may be thinking job boards are the key resource

88
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.974
in a job search. However, it is not the only tool for your job search.

89
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.319
We recommend you:

90
00:08:36.319 --> 00:08:42.080
Spend at least 30-35 hours a week on transitional
activities, and

91
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:49.010
Make 3-5 new contacts a week practicing
and using your personal branding statement,

92
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.340
sharing the message of WHO you are, and WHAT
you can do.

93
00:08:53.340 --> 00:09:01.884
The majority of jobs are landed through networking
with others. Plan your time to include networking conversations.

94
00:09:01.884 --> 00:09:05.360
To help you plan for weekly conversations

95
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:13.020
and maintain a focused search, you can proactively
use D&B Hoovers on the CRN and LinkedIn to

96
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:20.010
identify and develop a list of targeted companies.
You can also follow the targeted companies

97
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:26.315
on Twitter, Glassdoor, Facebook and LinkedIn
to increase your visibility.

98
00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:33.120
If you have not landed a job before your program
ends, don’t worry. You will have continued

99
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:39.200
access to many of the tools on the CRN through
our Alumni Services.

100
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:45.320
We hope this brief introduction to your LHH
program has been helpful to you.

101
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.460
Jumpstart your search today by taking full advantage 
of the LHH services your employer provided.
